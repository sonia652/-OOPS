        "#QUESTION 1: What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        "\n",
        "#. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming style where programs are designed using objects, which combine data (attributes) and functions (methods) together.It focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to make code modular, reusable, and easier to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "#QUESTION 2. What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "#. A class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects.It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "#QUESTION 3 . What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "#. An object in OOP is an instance of a class.It is a real-world entity that has data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods) defined by its class.\n",
