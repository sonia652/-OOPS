        "#QUESTION 1: What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        "\n",
        "#. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming style where programs are designed using objects, which combine data (attributes) and functions (methods) together.It focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to make code modular, reusable, and easier to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "#QUESTION 2. What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "#. A class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects.It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "#QUESTION 3 . What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "#. An object in OOP is an instance of a class.It is a real-world entity that has data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods) defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#QUESTION 4 .What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "#.Abstraction = Hiding implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "#Encapsulation = Hiding data\n",
        "\n",
        "#QUESTION 5. What are dunder methods in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "#. Dunder methods (short for “double underscore” methods) are special built-in methods in Python that have double underscores before and after their names, like __init__, __str__, __add__.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Key Points\n",
        "🔹 Also called magic methods or special methods\n",
        "🔹 They define the behavior of objects for built-in operations\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples\n",
        "__init__(self) → Constructor method, called when object is created\n",

        "__str__(self) → Defines string representation when using print()\n",

        "#QUESTION 6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "#. Inheritance is a concept where a class (child/subclass) can inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points\n",
        "🔹 Promotes code reusability\n",
        "🔹 Allows child classes to use and extend functionalities of parent classes\n",
        "🔹 Supports hierarchical relationships\n",

        "\n",
        "#QUESTION 7. What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "#.Polymorphism means “many forms”.\n",
        "It allows the same function or method name to behave differently based on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points\n",
        "🔹 Helps in using a single interface for different data types or classes\n",
        "🔹 Achieved via:\n",
        "\n",
        "Method Overloading (same method name with different parameters)\n",
